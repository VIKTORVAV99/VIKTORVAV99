### Hey!

#### About me
ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m an Informatics student with a passion for technology. Iâ€™m pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree at Halmstad University with a focus on Digital Design and Innovation, where I learn how to create and improve digital products and services.  Besides studying, I also work part-time as an Open Source Community Engineer at Electricity Maps, a company that provides real-time data on the carbon footprint of electricity. There, I contribute to various aspects of the project, such as data parsing, frontend development, and continuous integration.

ðŸ’» I have skills in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, SCSS and more. Iâ€™m especially interested in optimizing apps for size and performance, especially Single Page JavaScript apps that need to be fast and lightweight.

In my free time, I love to explore nature by hiking or on my mountain bike or on my skis, depending on the season or just watching a nice sci-fi show or movie with some popcorn and relax.

#### Goal
ðŸŽ‰ My goal is to make the world a better place through code and to help others do the same.
